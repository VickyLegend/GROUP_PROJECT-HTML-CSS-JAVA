To add a file to your local server you use "git add"
To check for an changes to your files, you use "git status"
To add all files changes to your local server, you use "git ." ( . = period )
After adding your files, you have to commit them to your local server which you'll use the "git commit" - command. 
   NOTE: When commiting your changes, you'll have to add a message and description.
         Example: Lets say you made changes in your css and few html files, you'll have to add them using the git add command and then use the git commit :::
                 git commit -m(m for message)"added new files"  -m(m for description)"few html and css changes"


After commitingyour chnages, you then have to push your files to your github. We use the "git push" command.
